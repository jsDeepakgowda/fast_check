        <h2>Push-Up</h2>
        <p>Push-ups are one of the most effective bodyweight exercises to target the chest, shoulders, and triceps. This simple yet powerful move also engages your core, helping to strengthen your entire upper body. Start in a high plank position, lower your body toward the ground, and then push yourself back up to the starting position. You can modify the push-up by doing it on your knees or elevating your feet for increased intensity.</p>

        <p>The pull-up is a fantastic exercise for building strength in the back and biceps. It is often used to test upper body strength. To perform a pull-up, grip a horizontal bar with your palms facing away from you (overhand grip). Pull your chin above the bar, focusing on using your back muscles to do the work.
